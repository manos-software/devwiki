# :simple-rust: Rust Developer Roadmap
## Legend
- ğŸŸ¢ Must Know
- ğŸ”µ Good to Know
- ğŸŸ£ Alternative
- â›” Not Recommended

## Foundation in Rust
### Getting Started
- ğŸŸ¢ Understanding Rust's philosophy and advantages (safety, speed, concurrency)
- ğŸŸ¢ Installation and environment setup (rustup, Cargo)

### Basic Syntax and Concepts
- ğŸŸ¢ Data types, variables, and mutability
- ğŸŸ¢ Control flow (if, else, loops)
- ğŸŸ¢ Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- ğŸŸ¢ Functions and modularization (use, mod, crate)

### Advanced Features
- ğŸŸ¢ Enums and pattern matching
- ğŸŸ¢ Error handling (Result, Option)
- ğŸŸ¢ Generics, traits, and lifetimes
- ğŸŸ¢ Concurrency and asynchronous programming

## Tooling and Environment
### Package Management and Build System
- ğŸŸ¢ Cargo: Dependencies, build system, testing, documentation
- ğŸŸ¢ Crates.io: Discovering libraries and tools

### Development Tools
- ğŸŸ¢ rustfmt for code formatting
- ğŸŸ¢ Clippy for linting and code recommendations
- ğŸ”µ Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) support (VSCode with Rust extension, IntelliJ Rust)

## Ecosystem and Libraries
### Essential Crates
- ğŸŸ¢ serde for serialization and deserialization
- ğŸŸ¢ tokio/async-std for asynchronous runtime
- ğŸŸ¢ reqwest for HTTP requests
- ğŸŸ¢ diesel for ORM and database interactions (for those using SQL databases)

### Web Development
- ğŸŸ¢ Actix Web / Rocket for web server frameworks
- ğŸ”µ Yew for frontend web development (WASM)

### Command Line Interface (CLI) Applications
- ğŸŸ¢ clap / structopt for parsing command line arguments

## Testing and Documentation
- ğŸŸ¢ Writing unit tests and integration tests
- ğŸŸ¢ Documentation best practices using Markdown in comments
- ğŸ”µ Using Doc-tests for code examples in documentation

## Version Control
- ğŸŸ¢ Git: Basic and advanced concepts (branching, merging, rebasing)

## Advanced Topics
- ğŸŸ¢ Unsafe Rust for interfacing with other languages or for low-level control
- ğŸ”µ Embedded programming with Rust
- ğŸ”µ Cross-compilation for different platforms
- ğŸ”µ Macros for metaprogramming

## Practices and Principles
- ğŸŸ¢ Following Rust's idiomatic practices (The Rust Book, Rust by Example)
- ğŸŸ¢ Understanding common patterns and anti-patterns
- ğŸŸ¢ Memory safety and efficient use of resources
- ğŸŸ¢ Contributing to open source Rust projects

## Continuous Learning
- ğŸŸ¢ Staying updated with Rust's evolution (Rust Blog, This Week in Rust)
- ğŸŸ¢ Engaging with the Rust community (forums, Reddit, Discord)
