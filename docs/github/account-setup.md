# :simple-github: GitHub Account Setup

Please create a GitHub user and send your username to your GitHub administrator.
They will add you to your company's organization.

1. Set up an account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). If you
   already have a personal account, you can use it and add your work email to the account.
2. Enable Two Factor Authentication on your GitHub account for security,
   [Configuring two-factor authentication - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)
3. For a two factor auth app, we recommend [Authy](https://authy.com/),
   but if you are already using Google Authenticator or another app, that is fine.
4. Click on your user icon, go to Your Profile and click Edit Profile.
   Set at least the Name field and ideally set other information and a profile photo.
5. Send your username, not your email to your GitHub admin so they can invite
   you to the organization.
6. You will need to check the email attached to your account and accept the invite.

## Best Practices

GitHub accounts are intended to be your personal account for life. As you move
between companies throughout your career, you will bring your account with you.
Because of that, if you are creating a new account, it is recommended that you
do not include the company name in your username.

GitHub allows you to register multiple emails to your account. Make sure that
your work email is added so that git commits are attributed to your account (see
[Git Setup](git-setup.md)).

GitHub notifications will go to the Primary email address set up in GitHub. It
may be helpful to set your primary email to your work email so that you receive
notifications from pull requests, etc.
