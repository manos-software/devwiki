# GitHub Account Setup

Please create a GitHub user and send your username to me. I will add you to the organization.

1. Set up an account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). If you
   already have a personal account, you can use it and add your work email to the account.
2. Enable Two Factor Authentication on your GitHub account for security, 
   [Configuring two-factor authentication - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)
3. For a two factor auth app, we recommend [Authy](https://authy.com/),
   but if you are already using Google Authenticator or another app, that is fine.
4. Click on your user icon, go to Your Profile and click Edit Profile.
   Set at least the Name field and ideally set other information and a profile photo.
5. Send your username, not your email to your GitHub admin so they can invite
   you to the organization.
6. You will need to check the email attached to your account and accept the invite.
